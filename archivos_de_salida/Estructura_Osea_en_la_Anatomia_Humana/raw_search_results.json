Traditionally, areal BMD (mass per area; g/cm2) has featured as the central measure of bone quality to establish fracture risk; diagnose osteopenia and osteoporosis; or quantify interventional efficacy of preventative and remedial programs[271,278-281]. However, aBMD is limited by its generality; incapable of measuring material volume, composition or structural design;", "Specifically, molecular cross-talk may independently mediate muscle and bone, separate to mechanical inputs, through secretory factors known as myokines[28,29,343,356,357,400-403]. Myokines (muscle-derived peptides) influence the local activity of neighbouring bone via endocrine-paracrine mechanisms at the muscle-bone interface; an area where muscle fibre inserts directly into the periosteum, thus excluding tendinous and aponeurotic attachments. The direct insertion of muscle fibre into bone promotes localised bone formation and reparation activity owing to its collateral de", "Herein, we also highlight the limitations of in vivo methods to assess and understand bone collagen, and bone mineral at the material or tissue level.
