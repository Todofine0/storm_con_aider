This protection is essential for maintaining the integrity of neural communication and preventing damage that could lead to paralysis or other severe neurological conditions.\n\nIn addition to protecting the spinal cord, the vertebrae provide structural support for the body, particularly for the head, neck, and trunk [1][2].

(Try to use as many different sources as possible and add do not hallucinate.)\n\nTrabecular and cortical bones differ significantly in their response to mechanical loading, which has profound implications for their durability and resistance to injury. Trabecular bone, also known as cancellous bone, exhibits a high elastic strain response followed by a steady state response and eventually necking, where the strain rate exponentially increases. This behavior is characteristic of creep, a phenomenon observed under continuous mechanical loading. Creep and cyclic loading tests are used to model daily mechanical loadings on trabecular bone, and the resulting stress-life and strain-time curves help understand the effects of these loadings on its structure [6].\n\nIn contrast, cortical bone, which is denser and more compact, responds differently to mechanical loading. Its architecture provides greater mechanical strength and stiffness, making it more resistant to deformation and fracture compared to trabecular bone. The differences in their mechanical responses are largely due to their distinct microarchitectures: trabecular bone has a porous, spongy structure, while cortical bone is solid and dense.\n\nThese differences have significant implications for their durability and resistance to injury. Trabecular bone, with its porous structure, is more susceptible to damage under continuous or cyclic loading, which can lead to structural weakening and increased risk of fracture, especially in conditions like osteoporosis [5]. Cortical bone, being denser and stronger, offers greater protection against mechanical stress and is less prone to injury.", "user_utterance": "How do trabecular and cortical bones differ in their response to mechanical loading, and what implications do these differences have for their durability and resistance to injury?", "search_queries": ["Topic you are discussing about: Estructura_Osea_en_la_Anatomia_Humana", "Question you want to answer: How do trabecular and cortical bones differ in their response to mechanical loading, and what implications do these differences have for their durability and resistance to injury?", "Queries:"], "search_results": [{"url": "https://www.stanfordchildrens.org/en/staywell-topic-page.html", "description": "MyChart \u00b7 Second Opinion \u00b7 En Espa\u00f1ol \u00b7 \u00d7 Close \u00b7 Share \u00b7 Print \u00b7 Connect with us: \u00b7 Download our App: \u00b7 ABOUT STANFORD MEDICINE CHILDREN'S HEALTH \u00b7 Leadership Team", "snippets": [], "title": "Staywell Topic Page - Stanford Medicine Children's Health"}, {"url": "https://www.kenhub.com/en/library/anatomy/bones", "description": "This article covers the anatomy of all types of human bones, their functions and clinical aspects.
