The large range of upper limb movements, coupled with the ability to easily manipulate objects with our hands and opposable thumbs, has allowed humans to construct the modern world in which we live. Figure 8.2 Axial and Appendicular Skeleton The axial skeleton supports the head, neck, back, and chest and thus forms the vertical axis of the body.\n[2]: The skeleton is subdivided into two major divisions\u2014the axial and appendicular. The axial skeleton forms the vertical, central axis of the body and includes all bones of the head, neck, chest, and back (Figure 7.2). It serves to protect the brain, spinal cord, heart, and lungs. It also serves as the attachment site for muscles that move the head, neck, and back, and for muscles that act across the shoulder and hip joints to move their corresponding limbs. The axial skeleton of the adult consists of 80 bones, including the skull, the vertebral column, and the thoracic cage.\n[3]: It also includes the pectoral girdle, or shoulder girdle, that attaches the upper limbs to the body, and the pelvic girdle that attaches the lower limbs to the body (Figure 1). Figure 1. The appendicular skeleton is composed of the bones of the pectoral limbs (arm, forearm, hand), the pelvic limbs (thigh, leg, foot), the pectoral girdle, and the pelvic girdle.

The decision to opt for surgery is influenced by several factors, including the severity of the fracture, the type of fracture, the location of the fracture, and the overall stability of the patient.\n\nFor instance, according to [2], early definitive surgical care is considered only in stable patients who have been adequately resuscitated. In unstable patients, damage-control orthopedics (DCO) is employed, which involves early debridement of surgical wounds and minimally invasive temporary fixation of long-bone fractures and dislocations. This approach is crucial in managing severe injuries where immediate stabilization is necessary.\n\nThe healing process of a bone fracture, as mentioned in [1], depends on various factors such as the cause of the fracture, the type of fracture, and the treatment required. More severe fractures can take a year or more to heal, highlighting the importance of appropriate surgical intervention to ensure proper alignment and healing.\n\nIn summary, surgical interventions for severe bone fractures and dislocations are guided by the need to stabilize the bone and ensure proper healing.

They are part of the 80 bones that make up the axial skeleton, which also includes the skull and the thoracic cage [1][3]. The primary function of the vertebrae is to protect the spinal cord, which is a critical part of the central nervous system that transmits signals between the brain and the rest of the body [2][3]. This protection is essential for maintaining the integrity of neural communication and preventing damage that could lead to paralysis or other severe neurological conditions.\n\nIn addition to protecting the spinal cord, the vertebrae provide structural support for the body, particularly for the head, neck, and trunk [1][2]. They serve as attachment sites for muscles that facilitate movement of the head, neck, and back, as well as muscles that act across the shoulder and hip joints to enable limb movement [3]. This dual role of protection and support underscores the importance of the vertebrae in maintaining overall body function and mobility.\n\nThe axial skeleton, of which the vertebrae are a part, forms the central axis of the body and supports the limbs, much like the earth spins around its center axis [1]. This central role ensures that the body can maintain its upright posture and perform various movements efficiently. Therefore, the vertebrae are not only vital for spinal cord protection but also for supporting the body's structural integrity and facilitating movement [2][3]."}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 803, "completion_tokens": 935, "total_tokens": 1738, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 192, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 611}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_60c260eebf"}}

As humans age, their bones typically become less dense, leading to a decrease in strength and an increased susceptibility to fractures, as noted in source [2].\n\nTrabecular bone, on the other hand, is subject to cyclic compressive loading, which can result in a loss of stiffness and strength, as well as the accumulation of residual strain even under low levels of applied load.

The fibula, being slim and roughly four-sided, is designed to withstand specific types of forces due to its shape and the strength of the muscles attached to it. This design allows the fibula to vary in shape based on the forces exerted by the muscles, which in turn affects its ability to resist injury. For instance, in many mammals like horses and rabbits, the fibula is fused with the tibia for part of its length, enhancing its structural integrity and resistance to certain types of fractures.\n\nFractures of the fibula are often associated with ankle injuries, but they can also occur independently or in conjunction with fractures of the tibia. The nature of these fractures is dependent on the mechanism of injury. Rotational forces typically result in spiral fractures, while angular forces lead to transverse or oblique fractures.

(Try to use as many different sources as possible and add do not hallucinate.)\n\nTrabecular and cortical bones differ significantly in their response to mechanical loading, which has profound implications for their durability and resistance to injury. Trabecular bone, also known as cancellous bone, exhibits a high elastic strain response followed by a steady state response and eventually necking, where the strain rate exponentially increases. This behavior is characteristic of creep, a phenomenon observed under continuous mechanical loading. Creep and cyclic loading tests are used to model daily mechanical loadings on trabecular bone, and the resulting stress-life and strain-time curves help understand the effects of these loadings on its structure [6].\n\nIn contrast, cortical bone, which is denser and more compact, responds differently to mechanical loading. Its architecture provides greater mechanical strength and stiffness, making it more resistant to deformation and fracture compared to trabecular bone. The differences in their mechanical responses are largely due to their distinct microarchitectures: trabecular bone has a porous, spongy structure, while cortical bone is solid and dense.\n\nThese differences have significant implications for their durability and resistance to injury. Trabecular bone, with its porous structure, is more susceptible to damage under continuous or cyclic loading, which can lead to structural weakening and increased risk of fracture, especially in conditions like osteoporosis [5]. Cortical bone, being denser and stronger, offers greater protection against mechanical stress and is less prone to injury. However, both types of bone are essential for overall skeletal integrity, and their unique properties contribute to the multifunctional role of bone in the human body, including structural support, mineral storage, and protection of vital organs [4]."}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 761, "completion_tokens": 928, "total_tokens": 1689, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 192, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 569}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_60c260eebf"}}

The axial skeleton, which consists of 80 bones, forms the vertical, central axis of the body and includes all bones of the head, neck, chest, and back (Source: ). Its primary role is to protect vital organs such as the brain, spinal cord, heart, and lungs. Additionally, the axial skeleton serves as the attachment site for muscles that move the head, neck, and back, and for muscles that act across the shoulder and hip joints to facilitate limb movement (Source: ).\nIn contrast, the appendicular skeleton, composed of 126 bones, is responsible for providing mobility and support to the limbs. The bones of the lower limbs, including the thigh, leg, and foot, are adapted for weight-bearing support and stability, as well as for body locomotion via walking or running (Source: ).

Some of the most common injuries include: Sports injuries. Bone fractures (broken bones). Dislocations. Muscle strains (pulled muscles). Ligament tears and sprains. Because so many conditions and injuries can affect your skeletal system, you might experience lots of different symptoms.\n: In group work with children of different ages who have a skeletal dysplasia, I have found some common responses to the questions, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d or, \u201cWhy are you so short?\u201d Young children, ages 6 and under, have routinely answered \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Some of them probably truly don\u2019t know, but I suspect that the main culprit is that they truly don\u2019t know how to answer the question.\n: Nevertheless, it is wise to keep radiation doses as low as possible, using only what is necessary to answer the medical question.

A query can either be a request for data results from your database or for action on the data, or for both.\nNow give your response. (Try to use as many different sources as possible and add do not hallucinate.)\nIn my practice, the most common skeletal conditions I encounter are related to trauma, such as sports injuries, bone fractures, dislocations, muscle strains, and ligament tears and sprains. These conditions often result from accidents, falls, or car accidents, which can significantly damage the skeletal system.\nTo diagnose these conditions, I typically use a combination of physical examinations, imaging studies, and sometimes laboratory tests. Imaging studies, such as X-rays, CT scans, or MRIs, are particularly useful for visualizing the extent of bone fractures, dislocations, and other structural abnormalities. For example, a skeletal survey may be ordered to evaluate conditions suspected to involve the bones, ensuring that radiation doses are kept as low as necessary, especially for sensitive populations like children and pregnant women.\nPhysical examinations help in assessing the range of motion, identifying points of tenderness, and evaluating the overall functionality of the affected area. Laboratory tests, though less commonly used for skeletal conditions, can be helpful in identifying systemic issues or infections that might be contributing to the skeletal problem.\nBy combining these diagnostic methods, I can accurately identify and assess the severity of skeletal conditions, allowing for appropriate treatment and management strategies.\nYou: Can you elaborate on the surgical interventions you commonly use for treating severe bone fractures and dislocations, and what factors influence your decision to opt for surgery?\nExpert: Topic you are discussing about: Estructura_Osea_en_la_Anatomia_Humana\nQuestion:\nCan you elaborate on the surgical interventions you commonly use for treating severe bone fractures and dislocations, and what factors influence your decision to opt for surgery?\nGathered information:\n: How long it takes a bone fracture to heal depends on a few factors, including: What caused it. Which bone is broken. Which type of fracture it is. Which treatment(s) you need. Any other injuries you experienced. Depending on which type of immobilization or surgery you needed to repair your fracture, you should be able to start moving again in a few weeks. More severe fractures can take a year or more to heal.\n: Early definitive surgical care should be considered only in stable patients who have been adequately resuscitated, whereas those who are unstable should undergo damage-control orthopedics (DCO). The DCO concept refers to early debridement of surgical wounds with minimally invasive temporary fixation of long-bone fractures and dislocations.\n: Broken bones heal by themselves \u2013 the aim of medical treatment is to make sure the pieces of bone are lined up correctly. The bone needs to recover fully in strength, movement and sensitivity. Some complicated fractures may need surgery or surgical traction (or both). Depending on where the fracture is and how severe, treatment may include:\n: La estructura \u00f3sea humana est\u00e1 compuesta por 206 huesos, sin contar los dientes: 80 huesos axiales, entre los que forman parte los huesos de la cabeza, la cara, las costillas y el estern\u00f3n; y 126 huesos apendiculares, entre los que se encuentran; brazos, hombros, mu\u00f1ecas, manos, piernas, y pies.\n: Use various combinations of keywords, always check the related queries box, and get a wider view of the timeline.\n: In a database context, a query is a request for information or data made by a user and written in a specific format.

A query can either be a request for data results from your database or for action on the data, or for both.\nNow give your response. (Try to use as many different sources as possible and add do not hallucinate.)\nSurgical interventions for treating severe bone fractures and dislocations are often necessary to ensure proper alignment and healing of the bones. The decision to opt for surgery is influenced by several factors, including the severity of the fracture, the type of fracture, the location of the fracture, and the overall stability of the patient.\nFor instance, according to , early definitive surgical care is considered only in stable patients who have been adequately resuscitated. In unstable patients, damage-control orthopedics (DCO) is employed, which involves early debridement of surgical wounds and minimally invasive temporary fixation of long-bone fractures and dislocations. This approach is crucial in managing severe injuries where immediate stabilization is necessary.\nThe healing process of a bone fracture, as mentioned in , depends on various factors such as the cause of the fracture, the type of fracture, and the treatment required. More severe fractures can take a year or more to heal, highlighting the importance of appropriate surgical intervention to ensure proper alignment and healing.\nIn summary, surgical interventions for severe bone fractures and dislocations are guided by the need to stabilize the bone and ensure proper healing. Factors such as patient stability, the severity and type of fracture, and the location of the fracture play a significant role in determining the necessity and type of surgical intervention.\n\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to", "response": {"id": "99d9c121-1a16-4ed6-bc7f-9bee81d3289c", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1725831565, "model": "deepseek-chat", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "produce the question.

Myokines (muscle-derived peptides) influence the local activity of neighbouring bone via endocrine-paracrine mechanisms at the muscle-bone interface; an area where muscle fibre inserts directly into the periosteum, thus excluding tendinous and aponeurotic attachments. The direct insertion of muscle fibre into bone promotes localised bone formation and reparation activity owing to its collateral de\n: The tibia and fibula are further joined throughout their length by an interosseous membrane between the bones. The fibula is slim and roughly four-sided, and its shape varies with the strength of the attached muscles. In many mammals, such as the horse and the rabbit, the fibula is fused for part of its length with the tibia. Fractures of the fibula usually are associated with an ankle injury, though they can occur in isolation (without ankle involvement) or in combination with fractures of the tibia (e.g., in severe injuries).\n: The nature of the fracture is dependent on the mechanism of injury. Combined tibia and fibula fractures may be the result of rotational or angular forces. Rotational forces generate spiral fractures, while angular forces generate transverse or oblique fractures. Isolated fibular shaft fractures are often the result of direct trauma to the area over the bone. Symptoms of bone fracture such as localized pain, swelling, and history of trauma over the site of injury are often present.\n: Use various combinations of keywords, always check the related queries box, and get a wider view of the timeline.\n: In a database context, a query is a request for information or data made by a user and written in a specific format.

(Try to use as many different sources as possible and add do not hallucinate.)\nThe geometry and size of bones, such as the fibula, significantly influence their mechanical properties and resistance to stress and injury. The fibula, being slim and roughly four-sided, is designed to withstand specific types of forces due to its shape and the strength of the muscles attached to it. This design allows the fibula to vary in shape based on the forces exerted by the muscles, which in turn affects its ability to resist injury. For instance, in many mammals like horses and rabbits, the fibula is fused with the tibia for part of its length, enhancing its structural integrity and resistance to certain types of fractures.\nFractures of the fibula are often associated with ankle injuries, but they can also occur independently or in conjunction with fractures of the tibia. The nature of these fractures is dependent on the mechanism of injury. Rotational forces typically result in spiral fractures, while angular forces lead to transverse or oblique fractures. Isolated fibular shaft fractures are usually caused by direct trauma to the bone. These different fracture types highlight how the fibula's geometry and size play a crucial role in determining its response to various types of mechanical stress and injury.\n\nReasoning: Let's think step by step in order to", "response": {"id": "c4aa679e-d1d2-4293-9419-0d2f77b9c846", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1725831692, "model": "deepseek-chat", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "produce the question.

The axial skeleton, which consists of 80 bones, forms the vertical, central axis of the body and includes all bones of the head, neck, chest, and back (Source: ). Its primary role is to protect vital organs such as the brain, spinal cord, heart, and lungs. Additionally, the axial skeleton serves as the attachment site for muscles that move the head, neck, and back, and for muscles that act across the shoulder and hip joints to facilitate limb movement (Source: ).\nIn contrast, the appendicular skeleton, composed of 126 bones, is responsible for providing mobility and support to the limbs. The bones of the lower limbs, including the thigh, leg, and foot, are adapted for weight-bearing support and stability, as well as for body locomotion via walking or running (Source: ). The upper limbs, on the other hand, are highly mobile and are utilized for a wide variety of activities, including manipulation of objects with our hands and opposable thumbs, which has been crucial for human development and construction of the modern world (Source: ).\nThe appendicular skeleton also includes the pectoral girdle (shoulder girdle) and the pelvic girdle, which attach the upper and lower limbs to the axial skeleton, respectively (Source: ).\n\nCurrent outline:\n# Introducci\u00f3n\n## Definici\u00f3n\n## Importancia\n## Estructura general del esqueleto humano\n# Componentes del sistema esquel\u00e9tico\n## Huesos del cr\u00e1neo\n### Huesos del neurocr\u00e1neo\n### Huesos del esplacnocr\u00e1neo\n## Columna vertebral\n### V\u00e9rtebras cervicales\n### V\u00e9rtebras tor\u00e1cicas\n### V\u00e9rtebras lumbares\n### V\u00e9rtebras sacras\n### V\u00e9rtebras cocc\u00edgeas\n## Huesos del t\u00f3rax\n### Huesos del estern\u00f3n\n### Huesos de las costillas\n## Huesos de las extremidades superiores\n### Huesos del hombro\n### Huesos del brazo\n### Huesos del antebrazo\n### Huesos de la mu\u00f1eca y la mano\n## Huesos de las extremidades inferiores\n### Huesos de la cadera\n### Huesos de la pierna\n### Huesos de la rodilla\n### Huesos del tobillo y el pie\n# Tipos de huesos\n## Huesos largos\n## Huesos cortos\n## Huesos planos\n## Huesos irregulares\n# Funci\u00f3n del sistema esquel\u00e9tico\n## Soporte y estructura\n## Movimiento\n## Protecci\u00f3n de \u00f3rganos vitales\n## Producci\u00f3n de c\u00e9lulas sangu\u00edneas\n## Almacenamiento de minerales\n# Desarrollo y crecimiento del esqueleto\n## Desarrollo fetal\n## Crecimiento postnatal\n## Factores que influyen en el crecimiento \u00f3seo\n# Alteraciones y enfermedades del sistema esquel\u00e9tico\n## Osteoporosis\n## Artritis\n## Fracturas\n## Tumores \u00f3seos\n# Diagn\u00f3stico y tratamiento\n## T\u00e9cnicas de diagn\u00f3stico\n### Radiograf\u00edas\n### Tomograf\u00eda computarizada (TC)\n### Resonancia magn\u00e9tica (RM)\n### Exploraci\u00f3n por ultrasonido\n## Tratamientos comunes\n### Fisioterapia\n### Cirug\u00eda ortop\u00e9dica\n### Terapia con f\u00e1rmacos\n# V\u00e9ase tambi\u00e9n\n# Referencias\n# Enlaces externos\n\nWrite the Wikipedia page outline (Use \"#\" Title\" to indicate section title, \"##\" Title\" to indicate subsection title, ...):", "response": {"id": "5138b6a6-2603-4029-9155-db0de9bcf4e5", "object": "chat.completion", "created": 1725831773, "model": "deepseek-chat", "choices": [{"index": 0, "message": {"role": "assistant", "content": "# Introducci\u00f3n\n## Definici\u00f3n\n## Importancia\n## Estructura general del esqueleto humano\n\n# Componentes del sistema esquel\u00e9tico\n## Esqueleto axial\n### Huesos del cr\u00e1neo\n#### Huesos del neurocr\u00e1neo\n#### Huesos del esplacnocr\u00e1neo\n### Columna vertebral\n#### V\u00e9rtebras cervicales\n#### V\u00e9rtebras tor\u00e1cicas\n#### V\u00e9rtebras lumbares\n#### V\u00e9rtebras sacras\n#### V\u00e9rtebras cocc\u00edgeas\n### Huesos del t\u00f3rax\n#### Huesos del estern\u00f3n\n#### Huesos de las costillas\n## Esqueleto apendicular\n### Huesos de las extremidades superiores\n#### Huesos del hombro\n#### Huesos del brazo\n#### Huesos del antebrazo\n#### Huesos de la mu\u00f1eca y la mano\n### Huesos de las extremidades inferiores\n#### Huesos de la cadera\n#### Huesos de la pierna\n#### Huesos de la rodilla\n#### Huesos del tobillo y el pie\n\n# Tipos de huesos\n## Huesos largos\n## Huesos cortos\n## Huesos planos\n## Huesos irregulares\n\n# Funci\u00f3n del sistema esquel\u00e9tico\n## Soporte y estructura\n## Movimiento\n## Protecci\u00f3n de \u00f3rganos vitales\n## Producci\u00f3n de c\u00e9lulas sangu\u00edneas\n## Almacenamiento de minerales\n\n# Desarrollo y crecimiento del esqueleto\n## Desarrollo fetal\n## Crecimiento postnatal\n## Factores que influyen en el crecimiento \u00f3seo\n\n# Alteraciones y enfermedades del sistema esquel\u00e9tico\n## Osteoporosis\n## Artritis\n## Fracturas\n## Tumores \u00f3seos\n\n# Diagn\u00f3stico y tratamiento\n## T\u00e9cnicas de diagn\u00f3stico\n### Radiograf\u00edas\n### Tomograf\u00eda computarizada (TC)\n### Resonancia magn\u00e9tica (RM)\n### Exploraci\u00f3n por ultrasonido\n## Tratamientos comunes\n### Fisioterapia\n### Cirug\u00eda ortop\u00e9dica\n### Terapia con f\u00e1rmacos\n\n# V\u00e9ase tambi\u00e9n\n# Referencias\n# Enlaces externos"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1098, "completion_tokens": 554, "total_tokens": 1652, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 192, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 906}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_60c260eebf"}}

The adult human body has 206 bones. These bones are divided into two main parts: Your appendicular skeleton and your axial skeleton. Your axial skeleton is made up of the bones along your vertical axis. Axial comes from the word \u201caxis,\u201d which means line.\n[4]\nAnother change in the axial skeleton was the loss of a direct attachment between the pectoral girdle and the head. This reduced the jarring to the head caused by the impact of the limbs on the ground. The vertebrae of the neck also evolved to allow movement of the head independently of the body. The appendicular skeleton of land animals is also different from aquatic animals.\n[5]\nTheocharopoulos N, Perisinakis K, Damilakis J, Papadokostakis G, Hadjipavlou A, Gourtsoyiannis N.

La columna vertebral, por ejemplo, protege la m\u00e9dula espinal, que es crucial para la transmisi\u00f3n de se\u00f1ales nerviosas entre el cerebro y el resto del cuerpo[2]. Adem\u00e1s, el cr\u00e1neo protege el cerebro, mientras que las costillas y el estern\u00f3n protegen el coraz\u00f3n y los pulmones[3]. El esqueleto axial, que incluye la columna vertebral y el cr\u00e1neo, es fundamental para la protecci\u00f3n de los \u00f3rganos vitales, mientras que el esqueleto apendicular, que comprende los miembros y la cintura p\u00e9lvica, proporciona soporte y estructura para la musculatura, facilitando el movimiento[7].\n\n## Producci\u00f3n de C\u00e9lulas Sangu\u00edneas\n\nEl tejido \u00f3seo contiene m\u00e9dula \u00f3sea, que es responsable de la producci\u00f3n de c\u00e9lulas sangu\u00edneas. La m\u00e9dula \u00f3sea roja, ubicada en la cavidad medular de los huesos, es el sitio principal de producci\u00f3n de gl\u00f3bulos rojos, gl\u00f3bulos blancos y plaquetas, que son esenciales para la funci\u00f3n inmunol\u00f3gica y la coagulaci\u00f3n sangu\u00ednea[9].\n\n## Almacenamiento de Minerales\n\nLos huesos act\u00faan como reservorios para minerales importantes como el calcio y el f\u00f3sforo. Estos minerales son cruciales para la salud \u00f3sea y tambi\u00e9n desempe\u00f1an roles vitales en otras funciones corporales, como la transmisi\u00f3n nerviosa y la contracci\u00f3n muscular[9]. Adem\u00e1s, el tejido \u00f3seo almacena grasa, proporcionando una fuente de energ\u00eda en situaciones de necesidad[10].\n\n## Facilitaci\u00f3n del Movimiento\n\nEl esqueleto apendicular, que incluye los huesos de los brazos, piernas, manos y pies, proporciona puntos de anclaje para los m\u00fasculos. Esta conexi\u00f3n entre el esqueleto y los m\u00fasculos permite el movimiento del cuerpo. Los huesos del esqueleto act\u00faan como palancas, y los m\u00fasculos ejercen fuerza sobre ellos para producir movimiento coordinado[6].\n\n## Evoluci\u00f3n y Adaptaci\u00f3n\n\nLa evoluci\u00f3n del sistema esquel\u00e9tico ha permitido adaptaciones importantes para la vida en tierra. Por ejemplo, la p\u00e9rdida de la conexi\u00f3n directa entre la cintura escapular y la cabeza en los vertebrados terrestres redujo el impacto en la cabeza causado por el movimiento de las extremidades[4]. Adem\u00e1s, la evoluci\u00f3n de la columna vertebral permiti\u00f3 un movimiento m\u00e1s independiente de la cabeza en relaci\u00f3n con el cuerpo, lo que es crucial para la orientaci\u00f3n y la percepci\u00f3n del entorno[4].\n\nEn resumen, el sistema esquel\u00e9tico humano es esencial para la protecci\u00f3n, el soporte, la producci\u00f3n de c\u00e9lulas sangu\u00edneas, el almacenamiento de minerales y la facilitaci\u00f3n del movimiento, desempe\u00f1ando un papel vital en la salud y la funci\u00f3n del cuerpo humano[6][7][9][10]."}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1336, "completion_tokens": 886, "total_tokens": 2222, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 256, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 1080}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_60c260eebf"}}

Name the main bones of the appendicular skeleton.\n[6]\nThe appendicular skeleton is a fascinating and complex part of the human body, comprising the bones that facilitate our most dynamic actions. From waving to walking, this division of the skeleton is instrumental in everyday movements and activities. The appendicular skeleton includes the bones of the upper and lower limbs, as well as the girdles that attach these limbs to the axial skeleton. Specifically, it consists of the pectoral or shoulder girdles, the arms and forearms, the hands, the pelvic girdle, the thighs and legs, and the feet.\n[7]\nHerein, we also highlight the limitations of in vivo methods to assess and understand bone collagen, and bone mineral at the material or tissue level. The inability to easily measure or closely regulate applied strain in humans is identified, limiting the translation of animal studies to human populations, and our exploration of how components of mechanical loading regimes influence mechanoadaptation.

Inicialmente, el esqueleto se forma a partir de cart\u00edlago y tejido conectivo, que posteriormente se reemplaza por hueso \u00f3seo a trav\u00e9s de un proceso conocido como osificaci\u00f3n endocondral[2].\n\n## Crecimiento y diferenciaci\u00f3n\n\nEl crecimiento del esqueleto es un proceso continuo que ocurre principalmente durante la infancia y la adolescencia. Durante este periodo, los huesos aumentan en tama\u00f1o y densidad, y se diferencian en estructuras espec\u00edficas que cumplen funciones particulares. Por ejemplo, los huesos de la columna vertebral crecen para formar el canal vertebral, que protege la m\u00e9dula espinal[3].\n\n## Factores influyentes\n\nVarios factores influyen en el desarrollo y crecimiento del esqueleto, incluyendo la gen\u00e9tica, la nutrici\u00f3n, y la actividad f\u00edsica. La gen\u00e9tica determina la estructura b\u00e1sica y la proporci\u00f3n de los huesos, mientras que la nutrici\u00f3n proporciona los nutrientes necesarios para la formaci\u00f3n y mantenimiento del tejido \u00f3seo.

Esta adaptaci\u00f3n implica cambios en la arquitectura \u00f3sea, como la densidad mineral \u00f3sea y la estructura trabecular, en respuesta a la carga mec\u00e1nica aplicada. Sin embargo, las limitaciones en la medici\u00f3n y regulaci\u00f3n de la carga mec\u00e1nica en seres humanos dificultan la traducci\u00f3n de estudios animales a poblaciones humanas[7].\n\n## Importancia de la arquitectura \u00f3sea\n\nLa arquitectura \u00f3sea, que incluye la composici\u00f3n de col\u00e1geno y la heterogeneidad dentro del hueso, es fundamental para la resistencia mec\u00e1nica del esqueleto. Cambios en la arquitectura \u00f3sea, como los observados en la osteoporosis y el envejecimiento, pueden comprometer la resistencia del hueso y aumentar el riesgo de fracturas[8].\n\n## Desaf\u00edos en el crecimiento\n\nEl crecimiento del esqueleto puede verse afectado por diversas condiciones m\u00e9dicas, como la displasia \u00f3sea, que puede causar anomal\u00edas en el desarrollo y crecimiento de los huesos.

In this case, a skeletal survey may be ordered to look for evidence of other injuries which may increase the suspicion for abuse. Allot at least an hour for the test. A typical skeletal survey consists of about 20 individual X-rays (radiographs) of the body.\nNevertheless, it is wise to keep radiation doses as low as possible, using only what is necessary to answer the medical question. Certain populations, such as children and pregnant women, are more radiation-sensitive and require special caution. Your healthcare provider may order a skeletal survey as part of the evaluation for some condition that is suspected to involve the bones.\nYou will be positioned by a radiology technologist and he/she will be available to answer any questions you may have during the test. After the X-rays are finished, you will be allowed to change and go home. There are no specific precautions to take afterward, and you may resume normal activities immediately. After the images are obtained, they are usually sent to a radiologist or other healthcare provider for interpretation. He or she will communicate the results in the form of a written report. Typically, results take no longer than one or two business days to become available.\n[2]\nLa estructura \u00f3sea humana est\u00e1 compuesta por 206 huesos, sin contar los dientes: 80 huesos axiales, entre los que forman parte los huesos de la cabeza, la cara, las costillas y el estern\u00f3n; y 126 huesos apendiculares, entre los que se encuentran; brazos, hombros, mu\u00f1ecas, manos, piernas, y pies.\n[3]\nCyclic compressive loading of trabecular bone can cause loss of stiffness and strength as well as the accumulation of residual strain even for low levels of applied load (114, 115). The rates at which modulus decreases and damage accumulation occurs in fatigue increase with increasing magnitudes of applied strain (114). The mechanisms of failure in fatigue appear to occur at the nanoscale (116). Static and cyclic tests on human trabecular specimens under physiologic loads (750\u20131,500 microstrain) indicate that the time required for full recovery of residual deformation is more than 20 times longer than the duration of the applied loads (115).\n[4]\nEarly definitive surgical care should be considered only in stable patients who have been adequately resuscitated, whereas those who are unstable should undergo damage-control orthopedics (DCO). The DCO concept refers to early debridement of surgical wounds with minimally invasive temporary fixation of long-bone fractures and dislocations.\nTheocharopoulos N, Perisinakis K, Damilakis J, Papadokostakis G, Hadjipavlou A, Gourtsoyiannis N.

The skeletal system includes all of the bones, cartilages, and ligaments of the body. It serves to support the body, protect the brain and other internal organs, and provides a rigid structure upon which muscles can pull to generate body movements. It also stores fat and the tissue responsible for the production of blood cells. The skeleton is subdivided into two parts. The axial skeleton forms a vertical axis that includes the head, neck, back, and chest.\nIt consists of the skull, vertebral column (including the sacrum and coccyx), and the thoracic cage, formed by the ribs and sternum. The appendicular skeleton is made up of all bones of the upper and lower limbs and the girdles which attach them to the axial skeleton.\n[6]\nInside the petrous part of the temporal bone are the three smallest bones of the body: the malleus, incus, and stapes. These three bones articulate with each other and transfer vibrations from the tympanic membrane to the inner ear. Laryngeal Skeleton\nThe 14 bones of the facial skeleton form the entrances to the respiratory and digestive tracts. The facial skeleton is formed by the mandible, maxillae (r,l), zygomatics (r,l), and the bones that give shape to the nasal cavity: lacrimals (r,l), nasals (r,l), vomer, palatines (r,l), and the nasal conchae (r,l). Cranial Bones\n[7]\nIn the trabecular compartment, 20% of the volume is composed of bone, and the remaining space is filled with marrow and fat. Trabecular bone transfers mechanical loads from the articular surface to the cortical bone. The hydraulic properties absorb shock. The material properties of the bone compartments differ: trabecular bone has lower calcium content and more water content compared to cortical bone.\nThe lack of focus on this cortex could be due to the limited sample size of the biopsy and questionable correlations to the overall cortical bone mass in the skeleton. Bone biopsies are performed on the iliac crest because it is a safe and convenient anatomic location. However, it may not be representative of the skeleton. The iliac crest is not weight bearing, and the trabecular bone has higher bone turnover than in the metaphysis of the long bones. The cortex is thinner than in long bones and there is not as much load bearing as in the axial skeleton.\n[8]\nBone mineral density (BMD) is a frequently used surrogate measure of mechanical competence and bone strength in clinical and experimental contexts, expressed in areal (aBMD) and volumetric (vBMD) terms. Traditionally, areal BMD (mass per area; g/cm2) has featured as the central measure of bone quality to establish fracture risk; diagnose osteopenia and osteoporosis; or quantify interventional efficacy of preventative and remedial programs[271,278-281]. However, aBMD is limited by its generality; incapable of measuring material volume, composition or structural design;\n[9]\nPlease refer to the appropriate style manual or other sources if you have any questions. ... Encyclopaedia Britannica's editors oversee subject areas in which they have extensive knowledge, whether from years of experience gained by working on that content or via study for an advanced degree. They write new content and verify and edit content received from contributors. ... Below is the article summary. For the full article, see skeleton.\n[10]\nThe bones of the human body can be divided into two broad groups, the axial skeleton and the appendicular skeleton. The axial skeleton comprises the bones found along the central axis traveling down the center of the body.\n[11]\nThe tibia and fibula are further joined throughout their length by an interosseous membrane between the bones. The fibula is slim and roughly four-sided, and its shape varies with the strength of the attached muscles. In many mammals, such as the horse and the rabbit, the fibula is fused for part of its length with the tibia. Fractures of the fibula usually are associated with an ankle injury, though they can occur in isolation (without ankle involvement) or in combination with fractures of the tibia (e.g., in severe injuries).\n[12]\nThe publisher's final edited version of this article is available at Injury \u00b7 This review will define the role of collagen and within-bone heterogeneity and elaborate the importance of trabecular and cortical architecture with regard to their effect on the mechanical strength of bone. For each of these factors, the changes seen with osteoporosis and ageing will be described and how they can compromise strength and eventually lead to bone fragility.\n[13]\nThe appendicular skeleton includes all bones of the upper and lower limbs, plus the bones that attach each limb to the axial skeleton. There are 126 bones in the appendicular skeleton of an adult. The bones of the appendicular skeleton are covered in a separate chapter. ...

En casos de sospecha de trauma no accidental, los proveedores de atenci\u00f3n m\u00e9dica pueden solicitar una radiograf\u00eda esquel\u00e9tica para buscar evidencia de lesiones adicionales que puedan aumentar la sospecha de abuso[1]. Esta prueba generalmente consiste en aproximadamente 20 radiograf\u00edas individuales del cuerpo y puede llevar al menos una hora[1]. Es importante minimizar las dosis de radiaci\u00f3n, especialmente en poblaciones sensibles como ni\u00f1os y mujeres embarazadas[1].\n\nAdem\u00e1s de las radiograf\u00edas, otras pruebas pueden incluir la evaluaci\u00f3n de la densidad mineral \u00f3sea (DMO), que es una medida sustituta frecuentemente utilizada para evaluar la competencia mec\u00e1nica y la fuerza \u00f3sea en contextos cl\u00ednicos y experimentales[8]. La DMO se expresa en t\u00e9rminos de densidad mineral \u00f3sea areal (aBMD) y volum\u00e9trica (vBMD), siendo la aBMD tradicionalmente la medida central para establecer el riesgo de fractura, diagnosticar osteopenia y osteoporosis, o cuantificar la eficacia de programas preventivos y remediales[8].\n\n## Tratamiento\n\nEl tratamiento de lesiones \u00f3seas depende del tipo y gravedad de la lesi\u00f3n. En pacientes estables que han sido adecuadamente resucitados, se puede considerar un tratamiento quir\u00fargico definitivo temprano, mientras que aquellos que son inestables deben someterse a una cirug\u00eda de control de da\u00f1os (DCO)[4]. El concepto de DCO se refiere a la desbridaci\u00f3n temprana de heridas quir\u00fargicas con fijaci\u00f3n temporal m\u00ednimamente invasiva de fracturas de huesos largos y luxaciones[4].\n\nPara trastornos \u00f3seos relacionados con la edad o enfermedades como la osteoporosis, el tratamiento puede incluir intervenciones farmacol\u00f3gicas y no farmacol\u00f3gicas. Estas pueden variar desde medicamentos que aumentan la densidad \u00f3sea hasta ejercicios f\u00edsicos dise\u00f1ados para fortalecer los huesos y mejorar la funci\u00f3n muscular[12].\n\n## Consideraciones Especiales\n\nEs crucial considerar las propiedades mec\u00e1nicas y estructurales del hueso en el tratamiento. La arquitectura trabecular y cortical desempe\u00f1a un papel importante en la resistencia mec\u00e1nica del hueso, y los cambios asociados con la osteoporosis y el envejecimiento pueden comprometer esta resistencia, llevando a una mayor fragilidad \u00f3sea[12].\n\nAdem\u00e1s, la ubicaci\u00f3n anat\u00f3mica de las biopsias \u00f3seas es importante. Aunque las biopsias se realizan com\u00fanmente en la cresta iliaca debido a su ubicaci\u00f3n segura y conveniente, esta \u00e1rea puede no ser representativa de todo el esqueleto, especialmente debido a diferencias en la carga y la tasa de renovaci\u00f3n \u00f3sea[7].\n\nEn resumen, el diagn\u00f3stico y tratamiento de trastornos \u00f3seos requieren una evaluaci\u00f3n cuidadosa y un enfoque multidisciplinario, considerando tanto las pruebas de imagen como las propiedades mec\u00e1nicas y estructurales del hueso."}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2237, "completion_tokens": 811, "total_tokens": 3048, "prompt_cache_hit_tokens": 192, "prompt_cache_miss_tokens": 2045}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_60c260eebf"}}

Esta estructura se divide en dos divisiones principales: la axial y la apendicular. La divisi\u00f3n axial incluye los huesos de la cabeza, la cara, las costillas y el estern\u00f3n, mientras que la divisi\u00f3n apendicular abarca los huesos de los brazos, hombros, mu\u00f1ecas, manos, piernas y pies [1].\nEl esqueleto facial, formado por 14 huesos, es esencial para la formaci\u00f3n de las entradas a los tractos respiratorio y digestivo. Estos huesos incluyen la mand\u00edbula, los maxilares (derecho e izquierdo), los zigom\u00e1ticos (derecho e izquierdo), y los huesos que dan forma a la cavidad nasal: los lacrimales (derecho e izquierdo), los nasales (derecho e izquierdo), el v\u00f3mer, los palatinos (derecho e izquierdo), y las conchas nasales (derecho e izquierdo) [2].\nAdem\u00e1s de proporcionar soporte y estructura al cuerpo, el esqueleto humano cumple funciones vitales como la protecci\u00f3n de \u00f3rganos internos, incluyendo el cerebro, la m\u00e9dula espinal, el coraz\u00f3n, los pulmones y los \u00f3rganos p\u00e9lvicos [3]. Los huesos tambi\u00e9n almacenan minerales importantes como el calcio y el fosfato, y contienen la m\u00e9dula \u00f3sea, que almacena grasa y es el tejido productor de c\u00e9lulas sangu\u00edneas [3].\nEl estudio de la estructura \u00f3sea humana es fundamental para comprender la anatom\u00eda y fisiolog\u00eda del cuerpo, y es esencial para el diagn\u00f3stico y tratamiento de numerosas afecciones m\u00e9dicas [4]. Para obtener m\u00e1s informaci\u00f3n sobre la estructura y funciones del sistema esquel\u00e9tico, se recomienda consultar fuentes especializadas como BYJU\u2019S [5].\n\n# Componentes del sistema esquel\u00e9tico\n\nEl sistema esquel\u00e9tico humano est\u00e1 compuesto por 206 huesos, sin contar los dientes, que se dividen en dos categor\u00edas principales: el esqueleto axial y el esqueleto apendicular [1][6][7].\n\n## Esqueleto axial\n\nEl esqueleto axial forma el eje vertical del cuerpo y est\u00e1 compuesto por 80 huesos que incluyen la cabeza, el cuello, la espalda y el pecho [1][6][8][7]. Este conjunto de huesos proporciona soporte y protecci\u00f3n a estructuras vitales como el cerebro, la m\u00e9dula espinal y los \u00f3rganos internos [8].\n\n### Columna vertebral\n\nLa columna vertebral est\u00e1 compuesta por 24 v\u00e9rtebras individuales, m\u00e1s el sacro y el c\u00f3ccix, que est\u00e1n fusionados en un solo hueso en el adulto [6][8]. Esta estructura es flexible y permite movimientos de la cabeza, cuello y cuerpo, adem\u00e1s de proteger la m\u00e9dula espinal [9][3].\n\n### Cr\u00e1neo\n\nEl cr\u00e1neo protege el cerebro y est\u00e1 formado por varios huesos que se fusionan en la infancia [8].\n\n### Caja tor\u00e1cica\n\nLa caja tor\u00e1cica est\u00e1 formada por 12 pares de costillas y el estern\u00f3n, y proporciona protecci\u00f3n a los pulmones y el coraz\u00f3n [6][8].\n\n## Esqueleto apendicular\n\nEl esqueleto apendicular est\u00e1 compuesto por 126 huesos y se refiere a todos los huesos de los miembros superiores e inferiores, as\u00ed como los huesos que los anclan al esqueleto axial [1][6][7]. Este conjunto de huesos est\u00e1 especializado para la movilidad y la locomoci\u00f3n, con articulaciones, ligamentos y tendones que mejoran su flexibilidad y resistencia [10].\n\n### Miembros superiores\n\nLos miembros superiores incluyen los huesos del brazo, hombro, mu\u00f1eca y mano [1].\n\n### Miembros inferiores\n\nLos miembros inferiores incluyen los huesos de la pierna, cadera, tobillo y pie [1].\n\n## Funciones del sistema esquel\u00e9tico\n\nEl sistema esquel\u00e9tico cumple varias funciones importantes, incluyendo:\n- **Soporte y movimiento**: Proporciona una estructura r\u00edgida sobre la cual los m\u00fasculos pueden actuar para producir movimientos del cuerpo [9][6].\n- **Protecci\u00f3n**: Protege \u00f3rganos internos vitales como el cerebro, la m\u00e9dula espinal, el coraz\u00f3n y los pulmones [9][6].\n- **Almacenamiento de minerales**: Act\u00faa como un sitio de almacenamiento para minerales importantes como el calcio y el f\u00f3sforo [9].\n- **Producci\u00f3n de c\u00e9lulas sangu\u00edneas**: La m\u00e9dula \u00f3sea roja en los huesos produce c\u00e9lulas sangu\u00edneas [9].\nEl sistema esquel\u00e9tico tambi\u00e9n incluye cart\u00edlagos y ligamentos que ayudan a mantener la integridad y la movilidad de las articulaciones [6].\n\n# Tipos de huesos\n\nLa estructura \u00f3sea humana se compone de 206 huesos, sin contar los dientes, que se pueden clasificar en dos grandes grupos: huesos axiales y huesos apendiculares [1].\n\n## Huesos axiales\n\nLos huesos axiales, que suman 80 en total, incluyen los huesos de la cabeza, la cara, las costillas y el estern\u00f3n. Estos huesos forman el eje central del cuerpo y proporcionan soporte y protecci\u00f3n a \u00f3rganos vitales como el cerebro y el coraz\u00f3n [1].\n\n## Huesos apendiculares\n\nLos huesos apendiculares, que totalizan 126, se encuentran en las extremidades y est\u00e1n involucrados en la movilidad. Este grupo incluye los huesos de los brazos, hombros, mu\u00f1ecas, manos, piernas y pies [1]. Dentro de este grupo, el f\u00e9mur, la tibia y la f\u00edbula son particularmente importantes en la estructura de las piernas.\n\n### Tibia y f\u00edbula\n\nLa tibia y la f\u00edbula est\u00e1n unidas a lo largo de su longitud por una membrana inter\u00f3sea. La f\u00edbula es delgada y de forma aproximadamente cuadrangular, y su forma var\u00eda seg\u00fan la fuerza de los m\u00fasculos adjuntos. En muchos mam\u00edferos, como el caballo y el conejo, la f\u00edbula est\u00e1 fusionada en parte de su longitud con la tibia. Las fracturas de la f\u00edbula suelen estar asociadas con lesiones en el tobillo, aunque tambi\u00e9n pueden ocurrir de forma aislada o en combinaci\u00f3n con fracturas de la tibia [11].\n\n### Superficies \u00f3seas\n\nLa f\u00edbula presenta diferentes superficies que desempe\u00f1an roles espec\u00edficos en la funci\u00f3n muscular. La superficie medial, delimitada por los bordes inter\u00f3seo y anterior, act\u00faa como punto de anclaje para los m\u00fasculos que extienden el pie y causan la dorsiflexi\u00f3n. La superficie lateral, por otro lado, se encuentra entre los bordes posterior y anterior, y su orientaci\u00f3n var\u00eda a lo largo de la longitud del hueso [12].\n\n### Consideraciones sobre la corteza \u00f3sea\n\nLa corteza \u00f3sea en la f\u00edbula y otros huesos puede variar en espesor y funci\u00f3n seg\u00fan la ubicaci\u00f3n anat\u00f3mica. Por ejemplo, la cresta iliaca, donde se realizan las biopsias \u00f3seas, no es representativa de todo el esqueleto debido a su falta de carga y mayor renovaci\u00f3n \u00f3sea en comparaci\u00f3n con las ep\u00edfisis de los huesos largos [13].\n\n# Funci\u00f3n del sistema esquel\u00e9tico\n\nEl sistema esquel\u00e9tico humano desempe\u00f1a m\u00faltiples funciones vitales en el cuerpo, incluyendo la protecci\u00f3n de \u00f3rganos vitales, el soporte estructural, la producci\u00f3n de c\u00e9lulas sangu\u00edneas y el almacenamiento de minerales esenciales.\n\n## Protecci\u00f3n y Soporte\n\nEl sistema esquel\u00e9tico proporciona un marco s\u00f3lido que soporta y protege el cuerpo humano y sus \u00f3rganos. La columna vertebral, por ejemplo, protege la m\u00e9dula espinal, que es crucial para la transmisi\u00f3n de se\u00f1ales nerviosas entre el cerebro y el resto del cuerpo[4]. Adem\u00e1s, el cr\u00e1neo protege el cerebro, mientras que las costillas y el estern\u00f3n protegen el coraz\u00f3n y los pulmones[8]. El esqueleto axial, que incluye la columna vertebral y el cr\u00e1neo, es fundamental para la protecci\u00f3n de los \u00f3rganos vitales, mientras que el esqueleto apendicular, que comprende los miembros y la cintura p\u00e9lvica, proporciona soporte y estructura para la musculatura, facilitando el movimiento[14].\n\n## Producci\u00f3n de C\u00e9lulas Sangu\u00edneas\n\nEl tejido \u00f3seo contiene m\u00e9dula \u00f3sea, que es responsable de la producci\u00f3n de c\u00e9lulas sangu\u00edneas. La m\u00e9dula \u00f3sea roja, ubicada en la cavidad medular de los huesos, es el sitio principal de producci\u00f3n de gl\u00f3bulos rojos, gl\u00f3bulos blancos y plaquetas, que son esenciales para la funci\u00f3n inmunol\u00f3gica y la coagulaci\u00f3n sangu\u00ednea[15].\n\n## Almacenamiento de Minerales\n\nLos huesos act\u00faan como reservorios para minerales importantes como el calcio y el f\u00f3sforo. Estos minerales son cruciales para la salud \u00f3sea y tambi\u00e9n desempe\u00f1an roles vitales en otras funciones corporales, como la transmisi\u00f3n nerviosa y la contracci\u00f3n muscular[15]. Adem\u00e1s, el tejido \u00f3seo almacena grasa, proporcionando una fuente de energ\u00eda en situaciones de necesidad[3].\n\n## Facilitaci\u00f3n del Movimiento\n\nEl esqueleto apendicular, que incluye los huesos de los brazos, piernas, manos y pies, proporciona puntos de anclaje para los m\u00fasculos. Esta conexi\u00f3n entre el esqueleto y los m\u00fasculos permite el movimiento del cuerpo. Los huesos del esqueleto act\u00faan como palancas, y los m\u00fasculos ejercen fuerza sobre ellos para producir movimiento coordinado[5].\n\n## Evoluci\u00f3n y Adaptaci\u00f3n\n\nLa evoluci\u00f3n del sistema esquel\u00e9tico ha permitido adaptaciones importantes para la vida en tierra. Por ejemplo, la p\u00e9rdida de la conexi\u00f3n directa entre la cintura escapular y la cabeza en los vertebrados terrestres redujo el impacto en la cabeza causado por el movimiento de las extremidades[16]. Adem\u00e1s, la evoluci\u00f3n de la columna vertebral permiti\u00f3 un movimiento m\u00e1s independiente de la cabeza en relaci\u00f3n con el cuerpo, lo que es crucial para la orientaci\u00f3n y la percepci\u00f3n del entorno[16].\nEn resumen, el sistema esquel\u00e9tico humano es esencial para la protecci\u00f3n, el soporte, la producci\u00f3n de c\u00e9lulas sangu\u00edneas, el almacenamiento de minerales y la facilitaci\u00f3n del movimiento, desempe\u00f1ando un papel vital en la salud y la funci\u00f3n del cuerpo humano[5][14][15][3].\n\n# Desarrollo y crecimiento del esqueleto\n\n## Desarrollo inicial\n\nEl desarrollo del esqueleto humano comienza tempranamente en el embri\u00f3n y se caracteriza por una serie de etapas cruciales que culminan en la formaci\u00f3n de los 206 huesos que componen el esqueleto adulto, sin contar los dientes[1]. Inicialmente, el esqueleto se forma a partir de cart\u00edlago y tejido conectivo, que posteriormente se reemplaza por hueso \u00f3seo a trav\u00e9s de un proceso conocido como osificaci\u00f3n endocondral[4].\n\n## Crecimiento y diferenciaci\u00f3n\n\nEl crecimiento del esqueleto es un proceso continuo que ocurre principalmente durante la infancia y la adolescencia. Durante este periodo, los huesos aumentan en tama\u00f1o y densidad, y se diferencian en estructuras espec\u00edficas que cumplen funciones particulares. Por ejemplo, los huesos de la columna vertebral crecen para formar el canal vertebral, que protege la m\u00e9dula espinal[3].\n\n## Factores influyentes\n\nVarios factores influyen en el desarrollo y crecimiento del esqueleto, incluyendo la gen\u00e9tica, la nutrici\u00f3n, y la actividad f\u00edsica. La gen\u00e9tica determina la estructura b\u00e1sica y la proporci\u00f3n de los huesos, mientras que la nutrici\u00f3n proporciona los nutrientes necesarios para la formaci\u00f3n y mantenimiento del tejido \u00f3seo. La actividad f\u00edsica, especialmente la carga mec\u00e1nica, juega un papel crucial en la adaptaci\u00f3n y fortalecimiento del esqueleto[17].\n\n## Adaptaci\u00f3n y mecanoadaptaci\u00f3n\n\nEl esqueleto humano es capaz de adaptarse a las demandas mec\u00e1nicas del cuerpo a trav\u00e9s de un proceso conocido como mecanoadaptaci\u00f3n. Esta adaptaci\u00f3n implica cambios en la arquitectura \u00f3sea, como la densidad mineral \u00f3sea y la estructura trabecular, en respuesta a la carga mec\u00e1nica aplicada. Sin embargo, las limitaciones en la medici\u00f3n y regulaci\u00f3n de la carga mec\u00e1nica en seres humanos dificultan la traducci\u00f3n de estudios animales a poblaciones humanas[17].\n\n## Importancia de la arquitectura \u00f3sea\n\nLa arquitectura \u00f3sea, que incluye la composici\u00f3n de col\u00e1geno y la heterogeneidad dentro del hueso, es fundamental para la resistencia mec\u00e1nica del esqueleto. Cambios en la arquitectura \u00f3sea, como los observados en la osteoporosis y el envejecimiento, pueden comprometer la resistencia del hueso y aumentar el riesgo de fracturas[18].\n\n## Desaf\u00edos en el crecimiento\n\nEl crecimiento del esqueleto puede verse afectado por diversas condiciones m\u00e9dicas, como la displasia \u00f3sea, que puede causar anomal\u00edas en el desarrollo y crecimiento de los huesos. En tales casos, la comprensi\u00f3n y el apoyo emocional de la familia son esenciales para ayudar a los ni\u00f1os a enfrentar los desaf\u00edos asociados con su condici\u00f3n[19].\n\n# Alteraciones y enfermedades del sistema esquel\u00e9tico\n\n## Osteoporosis\n\nLa osteoporosis es una enfermedad que afecta la densidad y la calidad del hueso, lo que resulta en huesos m\u00e1s fr\u00e1giles y propensos a fracturarse[18]. Factores como la deficiencia de estr\u00f3genos y el envejecimiento pueden afectar las propiedades mec\u00e1nicas del hueso, reduciendo su resistencia y dureza[18]. La osteoporosis puede tener implicaciones significativas para la comprensi\u00f3n y el tratamiento de las fracturas asociadas[18].\n\n## Fracturas\n\nLas fracturas son una de las alteraciones m\u00e1s comunes del sistema esquel\u00e9tico. Pueden ser causadas por diversos factores, incluyendo accidentes de tr\u00e1fico recientes[20], terapia hormonal que contenga estr\u00f3genos[21], y condiciones como la osteoporosis[18]. Las fracturas pueden causar inflamaci\u00f3n con hinchaz\u00f3n que dura de 2 a 3 semanas, seguida de la formaci\u00f3n de callo blando, donde comienza la formaci\u00f3n de nuevo hueso y la zona de la fractura se vuelve r\u00edgida[21].\n\n## Infecci\u00f3n \u00d3sea (Osteomielitis)\n\nLa osteomielitis es una infecci\u00f3n bacteriana del hueso que puede ocurrir especialmente en casos de fractura abierta, donde el hueso rompe a trav\u00e9s de la piel[22]. Esta condici\u00f3n aumenta el riesgo de infecci\u00f3n bacteriana y puede requerir tratamiento m\u00e9dico urgente para prevenir complicaciones graves.\n\n## Da\u00f1o Interno Adyacente\n\nLas fracturas no solo afectan el hueso, sino que tambi\u00e9n pueden causar da\u00f1o a estructuras circundantes como m\u00fasculos, nervios, vasos sangu\u00edneos, tendones y ligamentos[22]. Este da\u00f1o interno adyacente puede complicar la recuperaci\u00f3n y requerir atenci\u00f3n adicional para evitar secuelas a largo plazo.\n\n## Complicaciones Postoperatorias\n\nTras una cirug\u00eda relacionada con fracturas, el uso de antiinflamatorios no esteroides (AINEs) como la aspirina o el ibuprofeno puede aumentar el riesgo de complicaciones, incluyendo hemorragias y otros problemas[22]. Por lo tanto, es crucial seguir las recomendaciones m\u00e9dicas para la medicaci\u00f3n postoperatoria y gestionar el dolor de manera segura.\n\n# Diagn\u00f3stico y tratamiento\n\n## Diagn\u00f3stico\n\nEl diagn\u00f3stico de trastornos \u00f3seos puede implicar una variedad de pruebas y evaluaciones. En casos de sospecha de trauma no accidental, los proveedores de atenci\u00f3n m\u00e9dica pueden solicitar una radiograf\u00eda esquel\u00e9tica para buscar evidencia de lesiones adicionales que puedan aumentar la sospecha de abuso[23]. Esta prueba generalmente consiste en aproximadamente 20 radiograf\u00edas individuales del cuerpo y puede llevar al menos una hora[23]. Es importante minimizar las dosis de radiaci\u00f3n, especialmente en poblaciones sensibles como ni\u00f1os y mujeres embarazadas[23].\nAdem\u00e1s de las radiograf\u00edas, otras pruebas pueden incluir la evaluaci\u00f3n de la densidad mineral \u00f3sea (DMO), que es una medida sustituta frecuentemente utilizada para evaluar la competencia mec\u00e1nica y la fuerza \u00f3sea en contextos cl\u00ednicos y experimentales[17]. La DMO se expresa en t\u00e9rminos de densidad mineral \u00f3sea areal (aBMD) y volum\u00e9trica (vBMD), siendo la aBMD tradicionalmente la medida central para establecer el riesgo de fractura, diagnosticar osteopenia y osteoporosis, o cuantificar la eficacia de programas preventivos y remediales[17].\n\n## Tratamiento\n\nEl tratamiento de lesiones \u00f3seas depende del tipo y gravedad de la lesi\u00f3n. En pacientes estables que han sido adecuadamente resucitados, se puede considerar un tratamiento quir\u00fargico definitivo temprano, mientras que aquellos que son inestables deben someterse a una cirug\u00eda de control de da\u00f1os (DCO)[20]. El concepto de DCO se refiere a la desbridaci\u00f3n temprana de heridas quir\u00fargicas con fijaci\u00f3n temporal m\u00ednimamente invasiva de fracturas de huesos largos y luxaciones[20].\nPara trastornos \u00f3seos relacionados con la edad o enfermedades como la osteoporosis, el tratamiento puede incluir intervenciones farmacol\u00f3gicas y no farmacol\u00f3gicas. Estas pueden variar desde medicamentos que aumentan la densidad \u00f3sea hasta ejercicios f\u00edsicos dise\u00f1ados para fortalecer los huesos y mejorar la funci\u00f3n muscular[18].\n\n## Consideraciones Especiales\n\nEs crucial considerar las propiedades mec\u00e1nicas y estructurales del hueso en el tratamiento. La arquitectura trabecular y cortical desempe\u00f1a un papel importante en la resistencia mec\u00e1nica del hueso, y los cambios asociados con la osteoporosis y el envejecimiento pueden comprometer esta resistencia, llevando a una mayor fragilidad \u00f3sea[18].\nAdem\u00e1s, la ubicaci\u00f3n anat\u00f3mica de las biopsias \u00f3seas es importante. Aunque las biopsias se realizan com\u00fanmente en la cresta iliaca debido a su ubicaci\u00f3n segura y conveniente, esta \u00e1rea puede no ser representativa de todo el esqueleto, especialmente debido a diferencias en la carga y la tasa de renovaci\u00f3n \u00f3sea[13].\nEn resumen, el diagn\u00f3stico y tratamiento de trastornos \u00f3seos requieren una evaluaci\u00f3n cuidadosa y un enfoque multidisciplinario, considerando tanto las pruebas de imagen como las propiedades mec\u00e1nicas y estructurales del hueso.\n\n# V\u00e9ase tambi\u00e9n\n\n- **Huesos axiales**: Comprende 80 huesos que forman parte de la cabeza, la cara, las costillas y el estern\u00f3n, entre otros [1].\n- **Huesos apendiculares**: Incluye 126 huesos que se encuentran en los brazos, hombros, mu\u00f1ecas, manos, piernas y pies [1].\n- **Col\u00e1geno**: Es un componente clave en la estructura \u00f3sea, y su papel en la resistencia mec\u00e1nica del hueso es crucial, especialmente en condiciones como la osteoporosis y el envejecimiento [18].\n- **Trab\u00e9culas \u00f3seas**: Su arquitectura es fundamental para la resistencia mec\u00e1nica del hueso, y su deterioro puede comprometer la fuerza y la integridad \u00f3sea [18].\n- **Sesamoideos**: Son huesos peque\u00f1os y redondos incrustados en tendones o c\u00e1psulas articulares.

Otros sesamoideos se encuentran principalmente en las manos y los pies [10].\n- **Receptores sensoriales en los dedos**: Proporcionan retroalimentaci\u00f3n al cerebro sobre la posici\u00f3n y el movimiento del pie, mejorando la propiocepci\u00f3n y contribuyendo a la coordinaci\u00f3n y el equilibrio general [10].\n\n# Referencias\n\n1. ^ While every effort has been made to follow citation style rules, there may be some discrepancies.

La divisi\u00f3n axial incluye los huesos de la cabeza, la cara, las costillas y el estern\u00f3n, mientras que la divisi\u00f3n apendicular abarca los huesos de los brazos, hombros, mu\u00f1ecas, manos, piernas y pies [1]. El esqueleto facial, formado por 14 huesos, es esencial para la formaci\u00f3n de las entradas a los tractos respiratorio y digestivo [2].\n\nAdem\u00e1s de proporcionar soporte y estructura al cuerpo, el esqueleto humano cumple funciones vitales como la protecci\u00f3n de \u00f3rganos internos, incluyendo el cerebro, la m\u00e9dula espinal, el coraz\u00f3n, los pulmones y los \u00f3rganos p\u00e9lvicos [3].
